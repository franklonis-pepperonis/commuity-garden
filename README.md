# community-garden
We will be using Xcode to develop CommunityGarden since it will begin as an iOS app. 

The third part libraries we will be using are: Google Maps API, Google Places API, Mapkit API, Azure SQL DB, Azure Hosting


Mapkit is an Apple library so we have included it in the build for our xcode project
Google Maps API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/start
Google Places API: https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/start
Microsoft Azure: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-ios-how-to-use-client-library


Folder/File Structure

Our current project is stored in a folder called CommunityGarden which stores our similarily named XCode Project. In the CommunityGarden Folder, there is a main storyboard which contains all of our views and UI's. We also have 7 view controllers for each of our 7 views, which we split up so each one of our group members created one view. 

*** We implemented our AR portion seperately, but we ended up having trouble merging the two of them together. They both work seperately, but we hit a massive roadblock combining the two.
