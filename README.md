# commuity-garden
We will be using Xcode to develop CommunityGarden since it will begin as an iOS app. 

The third part libraries we will be using are: Google Maps API, Google Places API, Mapkit API, Azure SQL DB, Azure Hosting


Mapkit is an Apple library so we have included it in the build for our xcode project
Google Maps API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/start
